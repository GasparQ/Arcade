                    <h2>What's Arcade ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Arcade is a project that allow you to launch an arcade born with<br/>
                        multiple games in multiple graphic environment.<br/>
                        In addition, it allow you to add your own games and your own graphics<br/>
                        easily and that I'll teach you trough this tutorial.<br/>
                        To add your own modules, it is necessary for you to have solid bases in c++<br/>
                        If you'r not familiarly with this language, I advise you to learn it before because I won't teach you that.<br/>
                        For a rapid overview of how the project is build look at this Diagram<br/>
                        <img src="arcade.png" alt="UML Diagram for arcade" /><br/>
                        As you can see, the arcade is split in two parts that communicates each other through a stack of "AComponents *"<br/>
                        If you want to create a new Game you have to create a new class that inherit from IGame (we also add a class AGame if you want a fast and simple implementation)<br/>
                        As the same way for graphic libraries you have to create a new class that inherit from IGraph<br/>
                        All of this points will be shown to you in this tutorial.<br/>
                        It is important to note that we implements a common library at the root of the repository that you have to link to your libs.<br/>
                        You'll have to use it and moreover the constants in ArcadeSystem.hpp<br/>
                        In bonus, I'll show you how to create your own Components<br/>
                        If you need more precisions on classes, you can visit our <a href="html/index.html" target="_blank">API Reference</a><br/>

                    <h2>How can I add my own game ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I said before you can add your own game in our Arcade by creating a new class that inherit from IGame interface (or AGame).<br/>
                        Because IGame is an interface, it contains pure methods that you have to implement in your class<br/>
                        If you choose to inherit from AGame, you only have to implement the method "Compute" and the method "Restart"<br/>
                        Compute is the method that will be called at each frame of the program (60 times per seconds).<br/>
                        That's the method that will update your game components position, statement or the map<br/>
                        I advise you to use GameComponents directly in your code because you'll have to push them in the stack returned<br/>
                        by the method compute. They will not be deleted in graphic library so be careful in your memory usage.<br/>
                        The method restart is the method that, as its name shows, will allow the user to restart your game from the beginning<br/>
                        The method getName is a getter for the name of your game, and the method getSize is a method for the size of your map<br/>
                        Create a ".so" library and copy it in "./games/" directory, it will be recognized by the arcade<br/>
                        Now that you have the keys to add your own game, lets try to implement a Bounce & Break<br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="BNB" role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h2>TP. Lets bounce with Bounce & Break</h2>
                    <p>
                        Okey, now that we're aware of how to create an Arcade game, lets try to create a Bounce & Break<br/>
                        I will remember you the rules of the game and you will try to create it alone<br/>
                        The Bounce & Break is a game in which you are a bat and you have to bounce a ball in order to break blocks<br/>
                        Each time you break a block your score increase and you only have 3 ball<br/>
                        To help you here's an <a href="./html/classes.html" target="_blank">API reference</a> of our project<br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="ADDGr" role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h2>How can I add my own graphical interface ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have our first game we can start to implement a new graphic environment<br/>
                        To create a new graphic library you'll have to create a new class that inherit from IGraph interface<br/>
                        Like IGame, you will have to implements few methods in your class<br/>
                        The method "eventManagment" is a method that will handle an event of your library<br/>
                        It is important to note that this handle have to be non-blocking, either games will freeze<br/>
                        The method "display" is a method that will receive a stack of Components that have to be displayed by the library<br/>
                        For a <a href="./html/inherits.html" target="_blank">list of possible Components</a>, search those that inherit from "AComponent"<br/>
                        The method "setTitle" is a method that allow us to change the title of the window<br/>
                        When you'r done, create a ".so" library and copy it in "./lib/" directory of load it in argument of the program<br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="PRINT" role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h2>TP. Lets write some characters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Good, now you know how to create your graphic library, lets try to create your own text display library<br/>
                        The goal is to make a graphical display only by writing characters on the standard output<br/>
                        You can clear the terminal with 'system("clear")'. You will implement the display of<br/>
                        GameComponents, UIComponents(DualTextComponent) and HighScoreComponent<br/>
                        Don't forget that you have an <a href="./html/classes.html" target="_blank">API reference</a><br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="BONUS" role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h2>Bonus. Add your own components</h2>
                    <p>
                        As you saw previously, components are used to allow the communication between the game libraries and the graphic libraries<br/>
                        So it could be interesting to know how create my your own Component<br/>
                        It's as simple as others, you have to create a new class that inherit from the AComponent class or from another daughter class<br/>
                        However, this component will be internally used by your game and your library, if you want to propose you component in a new release<br/>
